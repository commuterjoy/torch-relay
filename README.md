Every 2 mins for the last two months I've logged the live location of the
torch relay runner.

This project contains that complete log file.

Files
-----

* gps.txt - all latitude and longitude points whilst the torch was moving.
* gps-complete.txt - complete timestamp, latitude, longitude, and torch status
