Every 2 mins for the last two months I've logged the live location of the
torch relay runner for the London 2012 Olympic Games.

This project contains the complete log files.

The torch ran from Saturday, 19th May 2012 to Friday, 27th July 2012 (70 days).

The last active co-ordinate is located in the middle of Tower Bridge, scene of the David Beckham opening ceremony set piece, so sadly the GPS data doesn't lead right up to the stadium and Heatherwick's cauldren.

Files
-----

- gps.txt - all latitude and longitude points whilst the torch was moving.
- gps-complete.txt - complete timestamp, latitude, longitude, and torch status

Notes
-----

- Co-ordinates are from the GPS device inside the torch relay vehicle.
- The data is accurate in so far as much as the BBC's torch relay tracking feed was correct.
- The first 30 minutes of data is missing because [I only realised](https://twitter.com/egzplicit/status/203754238105497600) that nobody might be recording this information for posterity on the morning that torch was lit.
- A raw dump of the feed is available from [matt.chadburn.co.uk/projects/torchrelay/gps.tar.gz](http://matt.chadburn.co.uk/projects/torchrelay/gps.tar.gz)
